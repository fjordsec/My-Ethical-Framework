# Ethical & Legal Framework for Security Research

This document outlines my personal commitment to ethical principles and legal compliance in all my cybersecurity learning and research activities.

All hands-on activities, including penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and network analysis, are strictly confined to systems I personally own in my lab environment or on platforms where I have explicit, documented permission to test (such as TryHackMe, PortSwigger, etc.).

### **Swedish Law: Unauthorized Data Access (dataintrång)**

I acknowledge and fully respect the **Swedish Penal Code (Brottsbalken) Chapter 4, Section 9 c §**, concerning Unauthorized Access to a Computer System (*dataintrång*).

This means I will never access, modify, or interfere with any computer system or data without clear, prior authorization from the system's owner. My activities are for learning and defensive purposes, not for unauthorized intrusion.

### **EU/Swedish Regulation: Data Protection (GDPR & IMY)**

I recognize the importance of data privacy and the regulations set forth by the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, as enforced in Sweden by the **Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten - IMY)**.

In any situation where I might encounter personal data during my studies (e.g., in sample log files or training scenarios), I am committed to treating it with the highest level of confidentiality and care, adhering to the principles of data minimization and privacy.
